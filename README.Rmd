The goal of `cyclingtools` is to provide tools for making easier to analyze data in cycling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `cyclingtools` from [GitHub](https://github.com/fmmattioni/cyclingtools) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fmmattioni/cyclingtools")
```
## Usage

### Critical Power

#### Demo data

The package comes with a demonstration data frame to show how the functions work and also to show you how you can setup your data:

```{r}
library(cyclingtools)

demo_data
```

#### Simple analysis

Perform a simple analysis from the chosen critical power models:

```{r}
simple_results <- critical_power(
  .data = demo_data, 
  power_output_column = "PO", 
  time_to_exhaustion_column = "TTE", 
  method = c("3-hyp", "2-hyp", "linear", "1/time"), 
  plot = TRUE, 
  all_combinations = FALSE
)

simple_results
```

You can also plot the results:

```{r dpi=300}
simple_results %>% 
  dplyr::filter(method == "3-hyp") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(plot)
```

#### All possible combinations analysis

You can also perform an analysis with all the possible combinations of time-to-exhaustion trials provided. All you need to do is to set `all_combinations = TRUE`:

```{r}
combinations_results <- critical_power(
  .data = demo_data, 
  power_output_column = "PO", 
  time_to_exhaustion_column = "TTE", 
  method = c("3-hyp", "2-hyp", "linear", "1/time"), 
  plot = TRUE, 
  all_combinations = TRUE
)

combinations_results
```

You can also plot the results:

```{r dpi=300}
combinations_results %>% 
  dplyr::slice(1) %>% 
  dplyr::pull(plot)
```

### You can also do all of these analyses in our shiny app:

[Critical Power Dashboard](https://www.shiny.fmattioni.me/CPapp/)

## Coming soon

* Training impulse analyses (iTRIMP, bTRIMP, eTRIMP, luTRIMP)

* Suggestions? Feel free to open an issue!
